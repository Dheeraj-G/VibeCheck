# VibeCheck - 404 Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status: 404 NOT_FOUND Error

### Possible Causes:

1. **Build Issues**: The deployment may have failed due to the configuration problems we've been fixing
2. **Incorrect URL**: You might be accessing the wrong URL
3. **Routing Issues**: Vercel configuration problems

### Steps to Resolve:

#### 1. Check Deployment Status
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Look for your "VibeCheck" project
- Check if the latest deployment succeeded or failed

#### 2. Verify the Correct URL
Your app should be accessible at:
```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

Common URL patterns:
- `https://vibecheck.vercel.app`
- `https://vibecheck-monorepo.vercel.app`
- `https://your-github-username-vibecheck.vercel.app`

#### 3. Test Basic Endpoints
Try these URLs to see what's working:
- `https://your-project.vercel.app/` (main page)
- `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/recommendations/health` (API health check)

#### 4. Check Build Logs
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Check for any error logs
4. Look at the latest deployment logs

#### 5. Redeploy After Fixes
Since we've fixed several configuration issues:
1. Commit the changes we made
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy

### Recent Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Fixed conflicting builds/functions configuration
- ✅ Fixed runtime version errors
- ✅ Fixed Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin issues
- ✅ Removed duplicate package-lock.json files
- ✅ Fixed vercel.json src path (frontend/package.json)

### Next Steps:
1. **Commit and push** the current changes
2. **Check Vercel dashboard** for deployment status
3. **Test the correct URL** once deployment succeeds
4. **Check logs** if still getting 404

### If Still Getting 404:
The deployment might still be in progress or failed. Check:
- Vercel dashboard deployment status
- Build logs for any remaining errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify GitHub repository is properly connected
